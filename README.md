# dext_settings_window

This is settings window I made to go along with the [dext](https://github.com/vutran/dext) launcher. Right now it can switch between themes and install new plugins by calling methods in the [dext-core-utils](https://github.com/vutran/dext-core-utils) module but there should be more to come. The window is built with reactjs over redux and uses radium for styling.

## Develop

1. Clone the repo

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mrjohnyhats/dext_settings_window
```

2. Run `npm install` in the new cloned directory.
